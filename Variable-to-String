int a = 5743;

LCDDisplay.println(DriverStationLCD.Line.kUser1, 1, "Variable a: " + a); 
// Since .println for the Driver Display can only take in Strings, this method is necessary for 
// printing variables to your console

// This line will print 'Variable a: 5743' to the first line of the Driver Station

// For simply printing the variable value without any text to accomodate it, use 'a + " "',
// resulting in the print of 'a '
